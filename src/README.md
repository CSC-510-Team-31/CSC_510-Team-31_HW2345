## Tiny Testing Framework used in example.py

### Introduction:

tylerkcraine and ntgomes made this in response to the fact that we couldnâ€™t use pytest for our unit testing, and that the tests (examples) must run during program execution. Keep in mind this testing framework is a bit more limited than pytest.

### General Setup:

You can import things from the src folder as you normally would. Ignore the auto completion complaining its taken care of in the example file. 

#### General Test Anatomy:
All of your tests must be contained in the example.py

Define a new method in the Example class within example.py. If the method starts with `eg_`, then it will be considered as a test for the class to run.

```python
class Example(object): # Inside here is where you will add your test method
	def eg_the(self):
		# An existing sample test method
		self.params = The()
        oo(self.params.the)
		assert true
	
	def eg_myNewPassingTest(self):
		#Passing test
		assert False
	def eg_myNewFailingTest(self):
		#Passing test
		assert False
```

## Note for Pycharm:
If you are using PyCharm with this framework, you will have to switch the unittest option for testing in your project settings.
To do this press (Ctrl + Alt + S). The setting will be under Tools > Python Integrated Tools. Change "default test runner" to unittest using the dropdown.
